/**
 * Splices one campaign track into every fifth queue position.
 *
 * Every fifth position (indices 4, 9, 14, 19, …) is a campaign slot: the base items are grouped into
 * runs of four and one campaign is inserted after each run. Injection happens on top of whatever
 * order the base queue already has, so a shuffled context keeps its shuffle and the campaigns ride
 * along.
 *
 * The campaign for a slot is fetched *at the moment the slot is reached*, one call per slot, never
 * as a batch up front. That is deliberate: the queue-slot RPC picks the least-recently-served
 * eligible campaign and marks it served in the same transaction, so the fairness guarantee is global
 * across every listener. Pre-fetching a batch would mark campaigns served long before any of them
 * reached a played slot, corrupting the bookkeeping for every other listener building a queue at
 * that moment.
 *
 * A slot whose fetch returns `null` (nothing eligible right now) is simply skipped; the base items
 * pass through unchanged and the run-of-four pattern resumes at the next boundary.
