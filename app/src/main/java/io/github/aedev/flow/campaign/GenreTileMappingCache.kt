     *    [CampaignRepository.ingestGenreTile]. Returning null here is what let a genre-scoped slot

     *  * genre context, reviewed as a mood (present key, null value) — returns `null`,
     *    deliberately: there is no genre promise to keep, so the slot behaves like an unscoped
     *    queue.
